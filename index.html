<h1>Eliza Jones</h1>

    Hi! My name is Eliza Jones. This is my first semester of college and I wasn't sure what college to go to but I thought BYU-I would be a good start!
</p>

<p>
    I am undecided about my major but was interested in taking this class. 
</p>

<p>
    I am from Mesa, Arizona. I'm the youngest of 3, 1 brother, 1 sister. I love my doggie Lulu and I've missed home each day in Idaho so far. 
</p>

<p>
    I have done dance since the age of 5, but ballet is my biggest love. In highschool I did cross country for 3 years. More things I love are poetry, photography and all forms of art.
