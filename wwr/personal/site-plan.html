Individuals will come to this website because it is filled with easy food ideas and recipes for those who are new to living on their own. Whether that be college, newly married, or an individual who just moved into their own place. They want simple, quick, and easy-to-follow recipes that fit into their busy lives but are also filling. While eating out is always an option when living alone, it can quickly take a toll on your bank account. Learning a few basic, affordable, and yummy recipes can save you money and give you the satisfaction of creating something yourself. This site is here to help make that transition to cooking for one easier and more rewarding in a sense. It can be difficult to start cooking or making food for yourself when you haven’t before, as learned from personal experience. My hope is to help others out with this issue. Eating is very important and without it, everything from learning to general health can feel out of balance. Some of the recipes will be ones that are extremely simple that consist mainly of store bought ingredients, for those days when you just don’t have the time or energy to cook from scratch. The others are actual recipes that can be done step by step to create more dishes helpful to building confidence in the kitchen.

Questions that will be answered from visiting the website are the following:
What can I cook quickly with minimal ingredients?
What are some good go-to recipes?
What can I make if I’m new to cooking?
What can I make with little time?


Unlike general recipe sites, my site targets individuals cooking for themselves, who are new to living on their own. This is why visitors will come to my site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions. With easy navigation, clear instructions, and helpful visuals, my goal is to make the site less intimidating for beginners. I hope to create a sense of belonging with confidence in cooking, experienced tips, or shared experience. I want to give out these recipes and make sure they are clear; minimize confusion or stress. I want to help others who can relate to my own experience, which has been having a hard time making food for myself. It’s not easy but it’s possible! I would like to help with this site.

      <h3>Easy Foods</h3>
      <p>
Page 2 will contain the easiest of foods to make. The go-to, fast, few ingredients and probably most affordable foods. Here are the foods I have in mind for this page: sandwiches,  scrambled eggs and bacon, cheese quesadilla, and mac and cheese.

      </ul>
      <h3>Detailed Recipes</h3>
      <p>
Page 3 will have the more complex recipes. These foods will be more filling and tasteful. However, this will include more details, ingredients and time. Because of this, I will provide step by step directions, guidance, certain measurements of ingredients and tips if known. My hope for this page is to really make others inspired to make nutritious dishes for themselves. I have struggled with this very much but have had to figure it out on my own. Earlier in my life, I often didn’t want to eat. I thought it would ruin my look to me but I have come to learn that it is extremely important and affects the activities in life. This is why eating is so important, it's essential to our successes in life. Foods that I have in mind for this page include: macaroni pasta salad, smoothies, lettuce wrapped burger, chicken bacon ranch wrap and ground beef taco bowl.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Each section will have a different background color. It's not clear in the wireframe about organizing the different sections so I want to clarify, it would be seperated by different colors and space. First section will have an introduction to the site and the second section will be details of that. Then lastly the third section is a preview of both pages.
