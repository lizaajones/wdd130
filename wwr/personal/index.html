            <p>Eating is essential to life because it gives us the energy and nutrition our bodies need to develop, function, and repair. Food has a significant impact on our physical, mental, and emotional health in addition to our basic survival needs; it affects everything from mood to brain function. Being able to cook well for ourselves is an essential ability that encourages creativity in the kitchen, saves money, and enables us to make healthier decisions. Additionally, cooking our own food gives us control over what we eat, enabling us to adapt our diets to meet our individual dietary requirements and tastes. Learning to cook creates a greater awareness for the work and skill required to prepare delicious, healthful meals in the process of nourishing our bodies.
